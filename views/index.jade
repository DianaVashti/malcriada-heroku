          h2 Who I Am
        p A highly educated Dominant woman in my twenties. I began to discover my proclivities for kink during my time at a prestigious women’s college where I studied sexuality. I can still remember the first kinky implement I purchased and the rush I felt as I whipped my girlfriend in my college dorm. That rush returns when chemistry and fantasy collide. I am deeply interested in the unconscious mind and the things we are inexplicably drawn towards. The psychological nature of BDSM keeps me ever engaged in this beautiful underworld.

        | In addition to being a degreed Sex Educator, I am also a highly trained exercise specialist. Over ten years of classical ballet training shaped my body and mind to reflect the physical discipline to which I submitted. I continue down this path of discipline as a Mistress. However, discipline informs my work just as much as my own mindfulness practices do.

        | Between all of my studies I have obtained a vast knowledge of the anatomical, emotional, and spiritual body. I truly believe in the healing abilities of BDSM. Play can help you work through taboos and insecurities as much as it can help you to process trauma.
